            <h3>Spill the Tea!</h3>
            <p> One of my favorite things about living in Ann Arbor is that I can explore my love for tea. I was able to find a few places that had awesome drinks which are now my go to spots.</p>
            <p>Here's a map that I've made of my favorite tea spots on campus. </p>
